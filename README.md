# Surfs-Up Challenge Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to inform a potential investor regarding a business proposal to open up an ice cream and surf shop on Oahu, Hawaii. The goal was to be able to take in weather data to ensure that the island would be a good fit for the business and that temperatures and precipitations wouldn't interfer too greatly with the business.

## Deliverables 1 and 2

After providing some initial data, the investor requested temperature data for the months of June and December.

A summary of the temperature data for June is shown below:

### Key Takeaways:
* Temperature on the island does not vary much between June and December
* June's maximum recorded temperature is only slightly higher than December's: 85 compared to 83.
* December's recorded low temperature is 8 degrees lower than June's: 56 compared to 64

Generally, this analysis would support the proposed business, indicating that there may be a demand for ice cream and surf rentals/accessories throughout the year, not to be prohibited by temperature, at least.
